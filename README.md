BurningPig
==========

###A Minecraft 1.3.2 Server in Node.js

BurningPig is a custom server for the creative game Minecraft:
<a href="http://minecraft.net">www.minecraft.net</a>

##Direction
I had originally forked the nodecraft project as the start of a modern Minecraft server.  That 
project looked like it was originally built for Node v0.4, and a lot of progress has been made 
since then. 

BurningPig is a fresh start using Node v0.8 and the goodness it has to offer, like streams!

##Status
Currently the client can connect and it gets a simple, flat dirt world.  You can just run around 
and fall off the small world.

The code is messy in places and will change as I figure out how I want to structure it.

##License
BuringPig is MIT licensed.  You know the drill.  Enjoy!
